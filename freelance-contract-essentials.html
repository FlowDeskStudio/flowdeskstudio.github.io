        <h1>Freelance Contract Essentials: 10 Clauses You Must Include</h1>
        <p>Protect your time, your work, and your income with clear agreements before every project.</p>
    </header>

    <article class="content">
        <p>Working without a contract is the fastest way to get burned as a freelancer. Unclear expectations lead to scope creep, late payments, and disputes that drain your time and energy. Yet many freelancers skip contracts because they don't know what to include or feel awkward asking clients to sign one.</p>

        <p>This guide covers the 10 essential clauses every freelance contract should have. You don't need a lawyer to write a basic agreement — just clear language that both sides understand.</p>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This guide provides general information, not legal advice. For complex projects or high-value contracts, consult a licensed attorney in your jurisdiction.
        </div>

        <h2><span class="clause-number">1</span>Scope of Work</h2>
        <p>This is the most important clause in your contract. It defines exactly what you will (and won't) deliver. Be specific about deliverables, formats, quantities, and what's excluded.</p>

        <div class="clause-box">
            <strong>Example language:</strong><br>
            "Contractor will design a 5-page responsive website including: Home, About, Services, Portfolio, and Contact pages. Design includes up to 2 rounds of revisions on mockups and 1 round of revisions after development. Additional pages, animations, custom illustrations, and third-party integrations are outside this scope and will be quoted separately."
        </div>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Use a bullet list for deliverables. The more specific you are, the easier it is to push back when a client asks for extras.
        </div>

        <h2><span class="clause-number">2</span>Payment Terms</h2>
        <p>Spell out how much, when, and how you'll be paid. Never leave payment expectations ambiguous.</p>

        <p>Key elements to include: total project fee or hourly rate, payment schedule (upfront deposit, milestones, or net terms), accepted payment methods, currency, and what happens if payment is late.</p>

        <div class="clause-box">
            <strong>Example language:</strong><br>
            "Total project fee: $5,000 USD. Payment schedule: 50% ($2,500) due before work begins; 50% ($2,500) due upon delivery of final files. Payment accepted via bank transfer or PayPal. Invoices are due within 14 days of receipt. Late payments incur a 1.5% monthly fee. Work will pause on accounts more than 14 days past due."
        </div>

        <p><strong>Recommended deposit structure by project size:</strong></p>
        <p>Under $2,000: 50% upfront, 50% on delivery.<br>
        $2,000-$10,000: 40% upfront, 30% at midpoint, 30% on delivery.<br>
        Over $10,000: 30% upfront, then monthly milestone payments.</p>

        <h2><span class="clause-number">3</span>Timeline and Deadlines</h2>
        <p>Define when work starts, key milestones, and the expected delivery date. Equally important: define what happens when the <em>client</em> causes delays.</p>

        <div class="clause-box">
            <strong>Example language:</strong><br>
            "Project start date: upon receipt of deposit and all required materials from Client. Estimated completion: 4 weeks from start date. If Client feedback is delayed more than 5 business days at any stage, the timeline will extend by an equivalent period. Contractor is not responsible for delays caused by late client feedback."
        </div>

        <h2><span class="clause-number">4</span>Revision and Change Policy</h2>
        <p>Without a revision limit, you'll end up in an endless loop of "just one more small change." Define how many rounds of revisions are included and what happens after that.</p>

        <div class="clause-box">
            <strong>Example language:</strong><br>
            "This project includes 2 rounds of revisions on deliverables. A revision round is defined as a single consolidated set of feedback submitted within 5 business days. Additional revision rounds will be billed at $X/hour. Changes to the project scope (new features, additional deliverables) require a separate change order with its own timeline and pricing."
        </div>

        <h2><span class="clause-number">5</span>Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
        <p>This clause determines who owns the work after the project is complete. The standard approach for freelancers: ownership transfers to the client <em>upon full payment</em>.</p>

        <div class="clause-box">
            <strong>Example language:</strong><br>
            "Upon receipt of full payment, Contractor assigns all intellectual property rights in the final deliverables to Client. Until full payment is received, all work product remains the property of Contractor. Contractor retains the right to display the work in their portfolio and promotional materials unless otherwise agreed in writing."
        </div>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>Portfolio rights matter:</strong> Always retain the right to show the work in your portfolio unless the client has a specific confidentiality need (and compensates you for it). Your portfolio is how you win future clients.
        </div>

        <h2><span class="clause-number">6</span>Confidentiality</h2>
        <p>Clients may share sensitive business information during a project. A simple confidentiality clause protects both parties.</p>

        <div class="clause-box">
            <strong>Example language:</strong><br>
            "Both parties agree to keep confidential any proprietary information shared during this project, including but not limited to business strategies, customer data, and financial information. This obligation survives the termination of this agreement for a period of 2 years."
        </div>

        <h2><span class="clause-number">7</span>Termination Clause</h2>
        <p>Sometimes projects need to end early. A termination clause protects you from doing work you won't get paid for.</p>

        <div class="clause-box">
            <strong>Example language:</strong><br>
            "Either party may terminate this agreement with 14 days written notice. In the event of termination, Client will pay for all work completed up to the termination date, plus any pre-approved expenses. The initial deposit is non-refundable. All incomplete deliverables and source files will be provided upon receipt of final payment."
        </div>

        <h2><span class="clause-number">8</span>Liability Limitation</h2>
        <p>This clause caps your financial exposure if something goes wrong. Without it, you could theoretically be liable for damages far exceeding your project fee.</p>

        <div class="clause-box">
            <strong>Example language:</strong><br>
            "Contractor's total liability under this agreement shall not exceed the total fees paid by Client for the project. Contractor is not liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages, including lost profits. Client is responsible for backing up all content and data provided to Contractor."
        </div>

        <h2><span class="clause-number">9</span>Independent Contractor Status</h2>
        <p>This clause clarifies that you're a freelancer, not an employee. It's important for both tax purposes and legal liability.</p>

        <div class="clause-box">
            <strong>Example language:</strong><br>
            "Contractor is an independent contractor, not an employee of Client. Contractor is responsible for their own taxes, insurance, and business expenses. Contractor retains the right to work for other clients and set their own schedule, provided deadlines are met."
        </div>

        <h2><span class="clause-number">10</span>Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p>If things go sideways, you want a clear process for resolving issues without jumping straight to court (which is expensive for everyone).</p>

        <div class="clause-box">
            <strong>Example language:</strong><br>
            "In the event of a dispute, both parties agree to first attempt resolution through good-faith negotiation. If negotiation fails within 30 days, the dispute will be resolved through binding arbitration under the rules of [arbitration body] in [jurisdiction]. The prevailing party may recover reasonable legal fees."
        </div>

        <div class="cta-box">

        <h2>Contract Best Practices</h2>

        <h3>Always Get It in Writing</h3>
        <p>Verbal agreements are technically enforceable but nearly impossible to prove. Even a simple email agreement is better than nothing, but a signed document (digital signature via DocuSign or HelloSign counts) is best.</p>

        <h3>Send the Contract, Don't Wait for One</h3>
        <p>Be the one who provides the contract. The person who drafts the agreement sets the terms. Waiting for a client's contract usually means accepting terms that favor them.</p>

        <h3>Keep It Readable</h3>
        <p>Dense legal jargon creates confusion and discourages clients from signing. Write your contract in plain English. The goal is mutual understanding, not intimidation.</p>

        <h3>Review Before Every Project</h3>
        <p>Don't reuse the exact same contract blindly. Review the scope, payment, and timeline sections for each new project. Copy-paste errors cause real disputes.</p>

        <h3>Track Your Contracts</h3>
        <p>Keep a spreadsheet or tracker with: client name, project name, contract date, payment terms, key deadlines, and payment status. This becomes essential as you take on multiple clients simultaneously.</p>

        <div class="cta-box">
            <h3>Track Finances Alongside Your Contracts</h3>
            <p>Know which clients have paid and which invoices are outstanding. Our Finance Dashboard tracks income, expenses, and invoices so nothing falls through the cracks.</p>
