        <h1>Freelance Retirement Savings: SEP IRA vs Solo 401(k)</h1>
        <p>The complete guide to choosing the right retirement plan, maximizing tax deductions, and building long-term wealth as a freelancer.</p>
    </header>

    <article class="content">
        <p>No employer match. No automatic payroll deductions. No HR department setting up your 401(k). As a freelancer, retirement savings is entirely on you — and that's actually an advantage. Self-employed individuals have access to retirement plans with higher contribution limits than most traditional employees get.</p>

        <p>The challenge isn't access. It's knowing which plan to choose and actually setting money aside from irregular income. This guide breaks down every option, compares them side by side, and gives you a concrete system for saving consistently.</p>

        <h2>Retirement Plan Options at a Glance</h2>

        </table>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>Key insight:</strong> You can combine plans. For example, you can contribute to both a Roth IRA ($7,000) and a SEP IRA (up to $70,000) in the same year, potentially sheltering $77,000 from taxes.
        </div>

        <h2>Traditional &amp; Roth IRA: The Starting Point</h2>

        <p>If you're just starting freelancing or earning under $60,000, a Traditional or Roth IRA is the simplest first step. You can open one at any major brokerage (Vanguard, Fidelity, Schwab) in about 15 minutes.</p>

        <h3>Traditional IRA</h3>
        <p><strong>Tax benefit:</strong> Contributions are tax-deductible now. You pay taxes when you withdraw in retirement.</p>
        <p><strong>Best if:</strong> You're in a higher tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement. The deduction reduces your current tax bill.</p>

        <h3>Roth IRA</h3>
        <p><strong>Tax benefit:</strong> No deduction now, but all growth and withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.</p>
        <p><strong>Best if:</strong> You're in a lower tax bracket now (early career) or you want tax-free income in retirement. Also offers more flexibility — you can withdraw contributions (not earnings) at any time without penalty.</p>

        <p><strong>Income limits for Roth IRA (2026):</strong> Full contribution if modified AGI is under $150,000 (single) or $236,000 (married filing jointly). Phase-out applies above these amounts.</p>

        <h2>SEP IRA: The Simple High-Contribution Plan</h2>

        <p>The SEP (Simplified Employee Pension) IRA is the most popular retirement plan for solo freelancers, and for good reason. It combines high contribution limits with extremely simple administration.</p>

        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <p>You contribute as the "employer" — up to 25% of your net self-employment income, with a maximum of $70,000 for 2026. There are no employee contributions, no annual filing requirements, and no plan documents to maintain beyond the initial setup form.</p>

        <div class="formula-box">
            <strong>SEP IRA Contribution Formula:</strong><br><br>
            Net SE Income = Gross Income - Business Expenses<br>
            Adjusted SE Income = Net SE Income &times; 0.9235 (deduct 1/2 SE tax)<br>
            Max Contribution = Adjusted SE Income &times; 0.25<br><br>
            <strong>Example ($100,000 net SE income):</strong><br>
            $100,000 &times; 0.9235 = $92,350<br>
            $92,350 &times; 0.25 = $23,087 max SEP contribution<br><br>
            <strong>Effective rate:</strong> ~20.5% of net self-employment income
        </div>

        <h3>SEP IRA Pros</h3>
        <p>Extremely easy to set up and maintain — no annual IRS filings required. High contribution limit ($70,000 cap). Flexible contributions — you can vary the amount each year or skip years entirely. Contributions are tax-deductible, reducing your current tax bill. Deadline to contribute: your tax filing deadline, including extensions (typically October 15).</p>

        <h3>SEP IRA Cons</h3>
        <p>No Roth (after-tax) option — all contributions are pre-tax only. No catch-up contributions for those 50 and older. If you have employees, you must contribute the same percentage for them. No loan provision — you can't borrow from the account.</p>

        <h2>Solo 401(k): Maximum Flexibility</h2>

        <p>The Solo 401(k) — also called an Individual 401(k) — is the most powerful retirement plan for freelancers, but it comes with slightly more complexity.</p>

        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <p>You make contributions in two capacities: as the "employee" (up to $23,500 for 2026, or $31,000 if 50+) and as the "employer" (up to 25% of net SE income). The combined limit is $70,000 ($77,500 if 50+).</p>

        <div class="formula-box">
            <strong>Solo 401(k) Contribution Formula:</strong><br><br>
            Employee contribution: up to $23,500 (or $31,000 if 50+)<br>
            Employer contribution: Net SE Income &times; 0.9235 &times; 0.25<br>
            Total = Employee + Employer (max $70,000 or $77,500 if 50+)<br><br>
            <strong>Example ($100,000 net SE income):</strong><br>
            Employee: $23,500<br>
            Employer: $100,000 &times; 0.9235 &times; 0.25 = $23,087<br>
            Total: $46,587
        </div>

        <h3>Solo 401(k) Pros</h3>
        <p>Highest total contribution potential. Roth option available (employee portion can be designated Roth). Loan provision — borrow up to $50,000 or 50% of balance. Catch-up contributions for age 50+ ($7,500 extra). At lower income levels, allows higher contributions than SEP IRA due to the employee contribution component.</p>

        <h3>Solo 401(k) Cons</h3>
        <p>Must file Form 5500-EZ annually once assets exceed $250,000. Slightly more complex setup (plan document, EIN for the plan). Must be established by December 31 of the tax year (unlike SEP IRA which can be set up until the tax filing deadline). Not available if you have full-time employees (other than a spouse).</p>

        <h2>SEP IRA vs Solo 401(k): Head-to-Head</h2>

        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr><th>Feature</th><th>SEP IRA</th><th>Solo 401(k)</th></tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr><td>Max contribution (under 50)</td><td>$70,000</td><td>$70,000</td></tr>

            </tbody>
        </table>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>Bottom line:</strong> If your net SE income is under $75,000, the Solo 401(k) usually lets you save more because of the employee contribution. If your income is above $200,000 and you want maximum simplicity, the SEP IRA is often the better choice. If you want a Roth option, Solo 401(k) is the only way.
        </div>

        <h2>How Much Should You Save?</h2>

        <p>The standard advice is 15-20% of your gross income, but as a freelancer with no employer match, you may want to aim higher. Here's a practical framework based on age:</p>

        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr><th>Your Age</th><th>Target Savings Rate</th><th>On $80K Income</th></tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr><td>20s</td><td>15% minimum</td><td>$12,000/year ($1,000/month)</td></tr>
                <tr><td>30s</td><td>20%</td><td>$16,000/year ($1,333/month)</td></tr>
                <tr><td>40s</td><td>25%+</td><td>$20,000/year ($1,667/month)</td></tr>
                <tr><td>50s</td><td>30%+ (use catch-up)</td><td>$24,000/year ($2,000/month)</td></tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <h2>Automating Retirement Savings with Irregular Income</h2>

        <p>The biggest obstacle for freelancers isn't choosing a plan — it's actually saving consistently when income fluctuates. Here's a system that works:</p>

        <h3>The Percentage-of-Revenue Method</h3>
        <p>Every time you receive payment from a client, immediately transfer a fixed percentage to your retirement account (or a dedicated savings account that you sweep to your retirement plan quarterly).</p>

        <div class="formula-box">
            <strong>Excel Retirement Savings Tracker:</strong><br><br>
            Column A: Payment Date<br>
            Column B: Client Name<br>
            Column C: Payment Amount<br>
            Column D: Retirement % (e.g., 20%)<br>
            Column E: =C2*D2 (Amount to transfer)<br>
            Column F: Running total: =SUM($E$2:E2)<br>
            Column G: Remaining to annual goal: =AnnualTarget-F2
        </div>

        <h3>The Quarterly Sweep</h3>
        <p>If transferring per payment feels like too much overhead, batch your contributions quarterly. This aligns well with estimated tax payments — set aside retirement savings and tax payments at the same time.</p>

        <p>Quarterly timeline: Q1 by April 15, Q2 by June 15, Q3 by September 15, Q4 by January 15 of the following year.</p>

        <h2>Tax Benefits: How Much You Actually Save</h2>

        <p>Retirement contributions are one of the most powerful tax deductions available to freelancers. Here's the real-world impact:</p>

        <div class="formula-box">
            <strong>Tax Savings Example:</strong><br><br>
            Net SE Income: $100,000<br>
            SEP IRA Contribution: $23,087<br>
            Federal Tax Bracket: 24%<br>
            State Tax Rate: 5%<br><br>
            Federal tax saved: $23,087 &times; 0.24 = $5,541<br>
            State tax saved: $23,087 &times; 0.05 = $1,154<br>
            <strong>Total tax saved: $6,695</strong><br><br>
            Effective cost of $23,087 retirement contribution: $16,392
        </div>

        <p>In other words, a $23,087 contribution only "costs" you $16,392 in reduced take-home pay. The rest comes from money you would have paid in taxes.</p>

        <h2>Getting Started: Step-by-Step</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Choose your plan.</strong> If your income is under $75K, start with a Solo 401(k) for maximum contribution flexibility. If you want simplicity above all else, go with a SEP IRA.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Open the account.</strong> Vanguard, Fidelity, and Schwab all offer free SEP IRA and Solo 401(k) accounts with no account minimums. The application takes 15-30 minutes online.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Choose your investments.</strong> A target-date fund (based on your expected retirement year) is the simplest set-and-forget option. Or use a simple three-fund portfolio: US stock index, international stock index, and bond index.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Automate contributions.</strong> Set up percentage-based transfers from your business account using the system described above. Even 10% is better than nothing.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Track and adjust.</strong> Review your contributions quarterly alongside your tax estimates. Increase your savings rate whenever your income grows.</p>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <strong>Important deadlines:</strong> Solo 401(k) plans must be established by December 31 of the tax year. SEP IRA plans can be established and funded up to your tax filing deadline (including extensions). Don't wait until year-end — start now and adjust later.
