        <h1>Freelance Monthly Budget Plan: Template &amp; Guide</h1>
        <p>Build a budget that works with irregular income — including tax savings, business expenses, and profit targets.</p>
    </header>
    <article class="content">

            <h2>Why Standard Budgets Don't Work for Freelancers</h2>
            <p>Most budgeting advice assumes you have a predictable paycheck that arrives on the same date every month. Freelancers don't have that luxury. Your income might be $8,000 one month and $3,000 the next. A client might pay late, or a project might wrap up earlier than expected.</p>
            <p>A freelance budget needs to handle three things that traditional budgets ignore: variable income, self-employment taxes, and irregular business expenses. You can't just allocate fixed percentages of a fixed paycheck — you need a system that adapts month to month while keeping your finances stable.</p>

            <h2>The Baseline Income Method</h2>
            <p>The most reliable approach for freelancers is the baseline income method. Instead of budgeting based on what you expect to earn, budget based on the minimum you can count on.</p>
            <p>Look at your last 6–12 months of income. Find your lowest month. That's your baseline. Build your monthly budget around that number. Everything you earn above the baseline goes into savings, tax reserves, or investment in your business.</p>
            <p>This approach means you're never scrambling during slow months because your budget already accounts for them. During good months, you're building a financial cushion instead of inflating your lifestyle.</p>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> If you're new to freelancing and don't have 6 months of data, use 60–70% of your average monthly income as your baseline. Adjust after you have more data points.
            </div>

            <h2>Building Your Budget Spreadsheet</h2>
            <p>Open a new Excel workbook and create three sheets: Monthly Budget, Annual Overview, and Actuals. The Monthly Budget is where you do your planning. The Annual Overview shows your 12-month picture. Actuals is where you record what actually happened each month.</p>

            <h3>Income Section</h3>
            <table>
                <tr><th>Row</th><th>Label</th><th>Formula / Input</th></tr>
                <tr><td>1</td><td>Gross Income</td><td><em>Enter actual amount received</em></td></tr>
                <tr><td>2</td><td>Tax Reserve (30%)</td><td><code>=B1*0.30</code></td></tr>
                <tr><td>3</td><td>Net Available</td><td><code>=B1-B2</code></td></tr>
            </table>
            <p>The 30% tax reserve immediately sets aside money for federal income tax, self-employment tax, and state tax. This percentage works for most freelancers in the 22% federal bracket. If you're in a lower bracket or a no-income-tax state, you can reduce it to 25%. If you're in a higher bracket, bump it to 35%.</p>

            <h3>Fixed Expenses Section</h3>
            <p>List every expense that stays roughly the same each month. These are your non-negotiable costs that you pay whether business is good or slow:</p>
            <table>
                <tr><th>Category</th><th>Examples</th></tr>
                <tr><td>Housing</td><td>Rent/mortgage, utilities, insurance</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Transportation</td><td>Car payment, insurance, transit pass</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Insurance</td><td>Health, dental, liability</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Subscriptions</td><td>Software (Adobe, Figma), cloud storage, phone</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Debt Payments</td><td>Student loans, credit card minimums</td></tr>
            </table>
            <p>Total your fixed expenses. This number should be comfortably below your baseline income. If it isn't, you need to either raise your rates or cut fixed costs before anything else.</p>

            <h3>Variable Expenses Section</h3>
            <p>These expenses change month to month and are the main area where your budget flexes with your income:</p>
            <table>
                <tr><th>Category</th><th>Budget Method</th></tr>
                <tr><td>Groceries</td><td>Set a fixed monthly amount</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Business expenses</td><td>Percentage of income or fixed cap</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Professional development</td><td>Monthly allocation (books, courses)</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Entertainment</td><td>Flexible — adjust based on income</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Savings / Emergency fund</td><td>Minimum 10% of net available</td></tr>
            </table>

            <h3>The Allocation Formula</h3>
            <p>Here's a simple allocation framework that works for most freelancers:</p>
            <table>
                <tr><th>Category</th><th>% of Gross Income</th><th>Formula</th></tr>
                <tr><td>Tax Reserve</td><td>30%</td><td><code>=B1*0.30</code></td></tr>
                <tr><td>Fixed Expenses</td><td>~35%</td><td><em>Sum of fixed costs</em></td></tr>
                <tr><td>Variable Expenses</td><td>~20%</td><td><em>Sum of variable costs</em></td></tr>
                <tr><td>Savings / Buffer</td><td>10%</td><td><code>=B1*0.10</code></td></tr>
                <tr><td>Profit / Reinvestment</td><td>5%</td><td><code>=B1*0.05</code></td></tr>
            </table>
            <p>If your fixed expenses eat more than 40% of your gross income, you're operating with very thin margins. Most financially healthy freelancers keep fixed costs under 35% of gross income.</p>

            <h2>Handling Irregular Income Months</h2>
            <p>The biggest budgeting challenge for freelancers is months where income drops significantly below your baseline. Here's how to handle it:</p>
            <p><strong>Build a runway.</strong> Aim for 3–6 months of fixed expenses in a separate savings account. This is your business emergency fund. It covers you during dry spells without forcing you to take on credit card debt or accept low-paying projects out of desperation.</p>
            <p><strong>Categorize expenses into tiers.</strong> Tier 1 expenses are absolute necessities (housing, food, insurance). Tier 2 expenses are important but can be reduced (subscriptions, dining out). Tier 3 expenses are optional (entertainment, travel). In a low-income month, cut Tier 3 first, then reduce Tier 2 if needed.</p>
            <p><strong>Smooth your income.</strong> Instead of spending everything you earn in a good month, "pay yourself" a consistent amount from your business account to your personal account. The surplus stays in the business account to cover future slow months.</p>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Set up two bank accounts — one for business income and expenses, one for personal spending. Transfer a fixed "salary" to yourself each month. This creates artificial income stability and makes budgeting much easier.
            </div>

            <h2>Tracking Actuals vs. Budget</h2>
            <p>A budget is only useful if you compare it to reality. At the end of each month, record your actual income and expenses on the Actuals sheet and calculate the variance for each category.</p>
            <table>
                <tr><th>Category</th><th>Budgeted</th><th>Actual</th><th>Variance</th></tr>
                <tr><td>Gross Income</td><td>$6,000</td><td>$7,200</td><td><code>=C2-B2</code> (+$1,200)</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Fixed Expenses</td><td>$2,100</td><td>$2,100</td><td>$0</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Variable Expenses</td><td>$1,200</td><td>$1,450</td><td>-$250</td></tr>
            </table>
            <p>Positive variance on income and negative variance on expenses (meaning you spent less than planned) are good. When you consistently overspend in a category, either your budget is unrealistic or you need to adjust your spending habits.</p>

            <h2>Annual Budget Planning</h2>
            <p>In addition to monthly budgeting, create an annual overview. This helps you plan for large, irregular expenses that don't happen monthly: annual software licenses, professional liability insurance renewals, conference fees, equipment upgrades, and estimated tax payments.</p>
            <p>On the Annual Overview sheet, list all 12 months across the top. Below each month, enter your projected income (use your baseline) and known expenses. This bird's-eye view shows you which months will be tight and which will have surplus — so you can plan ahead instead of reacting.</p>

            <h2>The Profit-First Approach</h2>
            <p>Many freelancers budget by subtracting expenses from income and hoping there's something left over. The profit-first approach flips this: take your profit first, then run your business on what remains.</p>
            <p>When income arrives, allocate in this order: taxes first, profit second, business expenses third, personal expenses last. If there isn't enough for expenses after taking profit, that's a signal to either increase revenue or cut costs — not to skip profit.</p>
            <p>Even if your "profit" allocation is just 5% of gross income, that money compounds over time into real savings, an investment portfolio, or a business growth fund.</p>

            <h2>Common Freelance Budgeting Mistakes</h2>
            <p><strong>Not accounting for taxes.</strong> This is the number one mistake. If you spend 100% of your income without setting aside tax money, you'll face a painful bill in April. Always set aside at least 25–30% of gross income for taxes before budgeting the rest.</p>
            <p><strong>Budgeting for best-case income.</strong> If you budget assuming you'll earn $8,000 this month and you only earn $5,000, your budget is already broken. Use your baseline or conservative estimate instead.</p>
            <p><strong>Ignoring annual expenses.</strong> That $1,200 annual software license or $2,000 insurance premium needs to be part of your monthly budget — divide by 12 and set aside that amount each month.</p>
            <p><strong>No emergency fund.</strong> Without a financial cushion, one slow month or one lost client can create a crisis. Build your runway before optimizing anything else.</p>
            <p><strong>Mixing business and personal finances.</strong> When everything runs through one bank account, you can't see how your business is actually performing. Separate accounts give you clarity.</p>

            <h2>Monthly Budget Review Checklist</h2>
            <p>At the end of each month, spend 15–20 minutes on this review:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Record actual income and expenses on your Actuals sheet</li>
                <li>Calculate variance for each category (budget vs. actual)</li>
                <li>Verify tax reserve account has the correct balance</li>
                <li>Check emergency fund status (are you at your 3–6 month target?)</li>
                <li>Identify any categories that are consistently over budget</li>
                <li>Adjust next month's budget based on what you learned</li>
                <li>Note any upcoming irregular expenses in the next 2–3 months</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This review takes less time than you'd spend worrying about money if you weren't tracking it. Fifteen minutes of intentional review replaces hours of financial anxiety.</p>
